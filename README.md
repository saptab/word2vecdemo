# word2vecdemo

Please download only the demo_till_nearest_word folder

It displays the vector representations of default words, adds new words to the visualization, prevents addition of out-of-vocabulary-words and shows nearest words for every word added.

The json files containing the word2vec mappings need not be downloaded.

Please click on only index.html (loads word2vec model, plots default words as pre-defined, can add a new word to the plot, stops addition of out-of-vocabulary words and displays nearest words when we hover to a particular word).

index\_heatmap.html file is being created with the final update of vector representation of the words in a color map. 

Currently, the word2vec model with vocabulary size 77000 is being used.

The demo folder (no longer to be used) displays the vector representations of default words and adds new words to the visualization.
